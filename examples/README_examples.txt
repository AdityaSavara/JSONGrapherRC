Each directory has a separate example with the python file to run beginning with the word "example"

example_1 shows how to launch a JSONGrapher window for dragging and dropping in multiple files for merging and plotting.

example_2 provides a tutorial like example on how to make JSONGrapher records and apply styles (layout_style and trace_styles_collection)

example_3 shows an example where the json record calls JavaScript source code from online to simulate and populate a dataseries.

example_4 shows an example where custom units are used.

example_5 shows an example where an equation with units is entered from python commands and plotted.

example_6 shows an example where equations with units are loaded from JSONGrapher records and plotted alongside datapoints.

example_7 shows an example of how to apply formatting as well as how to make, extract and use styles (layout_style and trace_style)

example_8 shows an example of how to further customize the formatting of individual traces, which can be used to make styles.

example_9 shows an example of 3D plots (both scatter3d and mesh3d, where there latter is a surface plot)

example_10 shows an example of how to create a bubble plot, which is another kind of 3D plot.
