# 1) The style for the "layout" (which is the graph title, axes, and legend)
# 2) The style for each "data_series" (which is each series, and makes them scatter, spline, etc)

# These are stored as dictionaries. So there is a layout_style and each data_series has a trace_style dictionary.

# In this example, we will change a graph and then extract some styles and use them.

# First, we will load two example records and plot them with the default settings of JSONGrapher.
