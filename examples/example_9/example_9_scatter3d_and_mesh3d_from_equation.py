#We're going to make scatter3d and mesh3d plots from equations in this example.
#3D plots can be made with points directly, equations are simply being used for convenience, here.
#We'll also first make a 2D plot from equation, for comparison, then make the 3D plot, extending one dimension of the same equation.

#First, we create a new JSONGrapherRecord that we'll put the equation into.
#It's a good practice to set our datatype, graph title, and axes titles directly after making a graph object.

Record.set_y_axis_label_including_units("k (s**(-1))")

### Let's add an equation_dict ###

#We'll define an equation, with parameters using the equation_dict format that json_equationer uses.
#The later variables define the default range and points resolution of the curve.
#Here, we are using a python dictionary. Python dictionaries are slightly different than JSON. With a json string, one would have to use json.loads()

    "equation_string": "k = A*(e**((-Ea)/(R*T)))",
    "x_variable": "T (K)",  
    "y_variable": "k (s**(-1))",
    "constants": {"Ea": "30000 (J)*(mol^(-1))", "R": "8.314 (J)*(mol^(-1))*(K^(-1))" , "A": "1*10^13 (s^-1)", "e": "2.71828"},

    "x_range_default": [200, 500],
    "x_range_limits" : [],
    "x_points_specified" : [],
    "points_spacing": "Linear",
    "reverse_scaling" : False
}

#Now we can add this equation record as a dataseries into the JSONGrapher record. 
# By default, the equation will be evaluated when added, and also when plotted.
Record.add_data_series_as_equation(series_name="Arrhenius Example 2D plot",equation_dict=equation_dict, trace_style = "spline")

### Now, let's add a 3D equation using json_equationer ###

#Here is a 3D example. 
# Note that the rate constant is now the "z_variable", and we will plot it as a function of T and Ea. 
# This means we also needed to change the "y_variable" compared to the 2D case.

#The 3D equation and number of points we're using will take a bit more time to evaluate.
