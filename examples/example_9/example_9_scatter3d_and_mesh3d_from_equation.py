#We're going to make scatter3d and mesh3d plots from equations in this example.
#3D plots can be made with points directly, equations are simply being used for convenience, here.
#We'll also first make a 2D plot from equation, for comparison, then make the 3D plot, extending one dimension of the same equation.

#First, we create a new JSONGrapherRecord that we'll put the equation into.
#It's a good practice to set our datatype, graph title, and axes titles directly after making a graph object.

### Let's add an equation_dict ###

#We'll define an equation, with parameters using the equation_dict format that json_equationer uses.
#The later variables define the default range and points resolution of the curve.
#Here, we are using a python dictionary. Python dictionaries are slightly different than JSON. With a json string, one would have to use json.loads()

    "x_range_limits" : [],
    "x_points_specified" : [],

#Now we can add this equation record as a dataseries into the JSONGrapher record. 
# By default, the equation will be evaluated when added, and also when plotted.

### Now, let's add a 3D equation using json_equationer ###

#Here is a 3D example. 
# Note that the rate constant is now the "z_variable", and we will plot it as a function of T and Ea. 
# This means we also needed to change the "y_variable" compared to the 2D case.

#The 3D equation and number of points we're using will take a bit more time to evaluate.
