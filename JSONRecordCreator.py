class JSONGrapherRecord:
    """
    This class enables making JSONGrapher records. Each instance represents a structured JSON record for a graph.
    One can optionally provide an existing JSONGrapher record during creation to pre-populate the object.

    Arguments & Attributes (all are optional):
        comments (str): General description or metadata related to the entire record. Can include citation links.
        data_type: The data_type is the experiment type or similar, it is used to assess which records can be compared and which (if any) schema to compare to. This ends up being the top level title field of the full JSONGrapher file.
        graph_title: Title of the graph or the dataset being represented.
        data_objects_list (list): List of data series dictionaries to pre-populate the record. 
        x_data: Single series x data in a list or array-like structure. 
        y_data: Single series y data in a list or array-like structure.
        x_axis_label_including_units: A string with units provided in parentheses. Use of multiplication "*" and division "/" and parentheses "( )" are allowed within in the units .
        y_axis_label_including_units: A string with units provided in parentheses. Use of multiplication "*" and division "/" and parentheses "( )" are allowed within in the units .
        layout: A dictionary defining the layout of the graph, including axis titles,
                comments, and general formatting options.
    
    Methods:
        add_data_series: Adds a new data series to the record.
        set_layout: Updates the layout configuration for the graph.
        to_json: Saves the entire record (comments, title, data, layout) as a JSON file.
        populate_from_existing_record: Populates the attributes from an existing JSONGrapher record.
